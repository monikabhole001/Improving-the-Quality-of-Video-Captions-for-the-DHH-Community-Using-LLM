People are doing things like explaining quantum physics and explaining Pokemon, and how they relate to each other - things you can't do with Google. The thing that's exciting people is twofold: one, how many users it's generated - within a week, it's had a million registered users - and two, who's actually interested in this. So data scientists, AI experts, people from sales and marketing, big heavy hitters are all really interested in this thing. And the other thing too, it has memory toning, so if you engage with it, it will take your search queries into account and serve you more answers like the ones you've shown interest in. It's really fascinating stuff!\n"
